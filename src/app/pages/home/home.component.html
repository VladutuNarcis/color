            Color is an element of art and design, characterized by hue, value (lightness or darkness), and intensity (saturation or purity). It is used to evoke emotions, create contrast, and convey meaning in visual compositions.

            <span class="home-text28">
              Color is how we see different wavelengths of light. Light is made up of tiny waves, and each color has a different wavelength. For example, 
              red light has longer waves, while blue light has shorter ones. When light hits an object, some wavelengths are absorbed, and others are reflected.

              When light enters our eyes, it passes through the lens and focuses on the retina at the back of the eye. The retina contains special cells called cones and rods. 
              Cones detect color and are sensitive to three types of light: red, green, and blue. These primary colors combine to let us see the full spectrum.
              Rods are more sensitive to light and help us see in dim conditions, but they don't detect color.
              The cones send signals through the optic nerve to the brain's visual cortex. Here, the brain processes the information from the cones, combining the signals to determine the specific color we see.

        Can you imagine a world without colour? Today, we have yellow, pastel yellow, 
        shiny yellow, yellow ochre—and the list goes on. Recognizing colours and giving 
        them some meaning has become a way of life, but how did we begin with creating a palette of these beautiful colours? 
        A historical look at colour offers a more cultural perspective, defined by time and place rather than association.
